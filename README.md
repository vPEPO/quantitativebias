# quantitativebias
This is an idea for a bias crypto aggregator of activity of projects.

**What is [Quantitative Bias](https://www.quantitativebias.com)?**<br>
Quantitative Bias would be a complementary research tool for every crypto user interested on measuring the social and development activity of any project on the crypto ecosystem measured on a bias way; this tool would only measure social activity and development activity of project through all the main channels.

**Why bias?**<br>
Because once created the tool, I forsee that there would not be any other progress related to its initial limited bias although there might be "forks" of it. Also, as the "**[Tokenization Era](https://hackernoon.com/market-outlook-on-tokenized-assets-a-usd24trn-opportunity-9bac0c4dfefb)**" is just beginning, you would have to comprehend that not every single project/token will have something to be developed (such as a dapp, or a blockchain), **its only mean of existance would be just to represent value**.

For the unique release of this tool, various parameters have to be available on it:

  - **SOCIAL ACTIVITY** <br>
	
		Guidelines:
		
**1** - **30-day cummulative social network activity from official accounts** 3pt <br>
 
		//
**2** - **7-day cummulative social network activity from official accounts** 2pt <br>
 
		//
**3** - **30-day cummulative social network mentions** (including but not limited to: $cashtags , #hashtags, etc) 2pt <br> 
 
		//
**4** - **7-day cummulative social network mentions** (including but not limited to: $cashtags , #hashtags, etc) 2pt <br> 
 
		//
**5** - **30-day social network activty from core members** 0.5pt <br>
 
		//
**6** - **30-day social network activty from core members** 0.5pt <br>
 
		//

- **CURRENCY TRAFFIC** <br>
  
		Guidelines:
		
**1** - **30-day average daily transaction value** 3pt <br>
 
		//
**2** - **7-day average daily transaction value** 2pt <br>
 
		//
**3** - **30-day average daily active addresses** 3pt <br>
 
		//
**4** - **7-day average daily active addresses** 2pt <br>
 
		//

- **DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY** <br>
 
		Guidelines:
		
**1** - **30-day cummulative repositories commits** <br>
 
		//
**2** - **7-day cummulative repositories commits** <br>
