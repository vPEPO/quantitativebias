# quantitativebias
This is an idea for a bias crypto aggregator of activity of projects.

What is "QuantitativeBias"?
Quantitative Bias would be a complementary research tool for every crypto user interested on measuring the social and development activity of any project on the crypto ecosystem measured on a bias way; this tool would only measure social activity and development activity of project through all the main channels.

Why bias?
Because once created the tool, I forsee that there would not be any other progress related to its initial limited bias although there might be "forks" of it. Also, as the "tokenization era" is just beginning, you would have to comprehend that not every single project/token will have something to be developed (such as a dapp, or a blockchain), its only mean of existance would be just to represent something.
